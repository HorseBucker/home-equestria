## Princess Celestia answers letters (player thread report 2026-10-29: Twilight talked about her
## unanswered letter to Celestia for ten in-game days, a goal that could never complete). A letter
## Spike sends with his green fire (spike.gd send_letter calls letter_sent through the group) books
## one reply per sender for the next morning, kept in the world save
## (world_context.state.celestia_replies) so a reload keeps it. When it is due Spike, if he is in
## the world and free, belches the reply scroll back up in green flame (spike.gd receive_letter);
## the sender and Twilight, whose letters Spike carries, remember it as a world event. With no
## Spike in the world the event alone arrives; if he stays asleep or busy it arrives without him
## at noon. Created by relationship_runtime.gd setup.
