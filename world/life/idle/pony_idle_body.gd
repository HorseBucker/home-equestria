## Standing body life on the NEAR clip tier (dev 2026-10-14: "her head moves i guess but not her
## body"). The NEAR tier plays the baked stand, one frozen pose, and ClipHead only brings the neck
## and head to life; this layers the rest of what HERO's solver shows on top of that pose:
## - breath: the loins lift the back a hair and the withers level it again
##   (pony_secondary_motion.gd apply_pose(), same bones, same amount);
## - weight: her barrel rolls onto the side she settles on and tips a little back or forward,
##   following the secondary's standing weight shifts (pony_secondary_motion.gd shift_weight()).
##   The four leg roots (flanks, shoulders) turn back by the same amount, so the legs keep hanging
##   as the clip posed them and the hooves stay where they stood (a few millimetres at most).
## Rotations only, every bone through pony_joint_limits. The secondary's values come on the 20 Hz
## logic beat and are eased here every step. hybrid_mare.gd switches it on only while the stand
## clip plays in NEAR within 15 m of the player, with no posture, hold, carry or kiss on her, and
## fades it out before switching it off. Placed right after ClipHead.
